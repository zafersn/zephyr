   :name: Hello hl78xx modem driver

   get  & set basic hl78xx modem information & functionality with HL78XX modem APIs

Overview
********

A simple sample that can be used with only Sierra Wireles HL78XX series modems

Building and Running
********************

This application can be built and executed on QEMU as follows:

.. zephyr-app-commands::
   :zephyr-app: samples/drivers/modem/hello_hl78xx
   :host-os: all
   :goals: build flash
   :compact:

To build for another board, change "qemu_x86" above to that board's name.
